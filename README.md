# The challenge:  
Non-communicable diseases (like cancer, diabetes) cause 70% of the deaths globally, and most of them are caused by long-term addictions and obesity that can be gotten rid of, by sports and an active lifestyle.  
# Solution:  
a platform that helps addicts to recover by encouraging them to find a sport that suits their abilities and personalities then help them organize and monitor their progress by their coaches based on data provided by the platform.  
# Services:  
## For users:  
- a platform that allows exploring the sports available in the region with each club's reviews.  
- a healthy and collaborative community that keeps the user's passion and encourages him to continue his progress.  
## For gym owners:

# What sets it apart from the rest of the apps:  
## Open market & Inclusiveness:  
the platform is designed to provide an ecosystem for both users and (services/products) providers that handle every bit of their work, with the opportunity for new sports and startups, which allows it to spread widely.
## Good influence & Addiction treatment:
Although the platform is not aimed at addicts only, it provides special recovery methods for them. With healthy and passionate companions and professional coaches, the platform will change the user's mindset and make him a better person.  
## Supportive community: 
It doesn't depend only on perfectional trainers but you can meet individuals who have the same interests and goals, then scheduling sessions according to our self-(recovery/training) programs to train together and help each other especially when it comes to getting rid of addictions.
